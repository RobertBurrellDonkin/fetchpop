## Apache James FetchPop Limitations

For many years, I ran a local personal fork of Apache James. Key features

* Efficiently serve over IMAP mail originally delivered to many accounts beyond the limits of clients like Thunderbird to cache locally;
* Full access to archives even when machine is offline;
* Advanced filtering using SIEVE;
* Portability, able to zip and relocate;
* Mail accessed via POP3

But the James FetchPop implementation has known limitations. Would need a complete refactor and proper modularization.
